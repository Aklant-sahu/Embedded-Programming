digitalRead() works on all pins. It will just round the analog value received and present
 it to you. If analogRead(A0) is greater than or equal to 512, digitalRead(A0) will be 1, else 0.
digitalWrite() works on all pins, with allowed parameter 0 or 1. 
digitalWrite(A0,0) is the same as analogWrite(A0,0), and digitalWrite(A0,1)
 is the same as analogWrite(A0,255)
analogRead() works only on analog pins. It can take any value between 0 and 1023.
analogWrite() works on all analog pins and all digital PWM pins.
 You can supply it any value between 0 and 255
digital pin value HIGH is same as int value 1 or logic 1 so HIGH==1
and low value is same as innt value 0 LOW==0
